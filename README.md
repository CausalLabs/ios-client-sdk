# Causal Labs iOS SDK

[![CI](https://github.com/CausalLabs/ios-client-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CausalLabs/ios-client-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![CocoaPods Integration](https://github.com/CausalLabs/ios-client-sdk/actions/workflows/pod-integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CausalLabs/ios-client-sdk/actions/workflows/pod-integration.yml)

The [Causal Labs](https://www.causallabs.io) iOS SDK integrates Causal with native iOS apps.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Swift 5.8+
- Xcode 14.0+

## Package Installation

### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
pod 'CausalLabsSDK', '~> 0.7.0'
```

> **Note**
>
> If you [check-in the `Pods/` directory into git](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control), we recommend that you git ignore `Pods/CausalLabsSDK/compiler/`.

## Causal Compiler Configuration

1. Install Java 11 (via [homebrew](https://brew.sh))

```bash
brew install java11
```

2. Update your `.zprofile` or `.zshrc` (or equivalent)

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/bin:$PATH"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/include $CPPFLAGS"
```

> **Note**
>
> Homebrew should indicate the path to `java` when installation completes.
>
> Depending on your machine configuration, `java` may be located somewhere else.
> If so, you need to replace the path `/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/libexec/openjdk.jdk` to correspond to your Java installation location.

3. Verify `java` is successfully installed and in your `PATH`

```bash
$ which java
/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/bin/java
```

```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.18" 2023-01-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 11.0.18+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 11.0.18+0, mixed mode)
```

4. Symlink the JDK so that `causalc` (and `/usr/libexec/java_home`) can find it

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-11.jdk
```

## Xcode Project Configuration

After integrating the SDK via CocoaPods and installing Java, you'll need to add a build script phase to your Xcode project.

1. Navigate to your main application target's `Build Phases` tab.
1. Add a new `Run Script Phase` **before** the `Compile Sources` phase.
1. Name the script phase `FDL Generation`.
1. Set the shell to `/bin/sh`.
1. Create your `Features.fdl` file and place it in your project directory.
1. Add a new file to your project called `Causal.generated.swift`.
1. Add the following script to invoke the compiler and generate your Swift code from your FDL.

```bash
${PROJECT_DIR}/Pods/CausalLabsSDK/compiler/bin/compiler --swift \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/PATH_TO_YOUR/Causal.generated.swift \
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/PATH_TO_YOUR/Features.fdl
```

> **Note**
>
> Remember to replace `PATH_TO_YOUR` above with the paths to your own files.

**Now you can build and run!** If your build succeeds, you should see your generated code in `Causal.generated.swift`. If your build fails, check the build logs and ensure your paths to the compiler and source files are correct.
